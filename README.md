Contact Hours: 3-0  
Pre Requisites: Database Management System  
## Course Introduction
Advanced Database Management Systems is an extension to “Database Systems” course. The aim of the course is to enhance the previous knowledge of database systems by
deepening the understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of the database technologies, and showing the need for distributed database technology to tackle deficiencies of the centralized database systems. Moreover, it focuses to introduce the basic principles and implementation techniques of distributed database systems, and expose emerging research issues in database systems and application development.
